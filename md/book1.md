# Iliad (1713)


### Book 1

**1.1.1**	Achilles’ wrath, to Greece the direful spring
**1.1.2**	Of woes unnumber’d, heavenly goddess, sing!
**1.1.3**	That wrath which hurl’d to Pluto’s gloomy reign
**1.1.4**	The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;
**1.1.5**	Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,
**1.1.6**	Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.
**1.1.7**	Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,
**1.1.8**	Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove!



**1.2.1**	Declare, O Muse! in what ill-fated hour
**1.2.2**	Sprung the fierce strife, from what offended power
**1.2.3**	Latona’s son a dire contagion spread,
**1.2.4**	And heap’d the camp with mountains of the dead;
**1.2.5**	The king of men his reverent priest defied,
**1.2.6**	And for the king’s offence the people died.



**1.3.1**	For Chryses sought with costly gifts to gain
**1.3.2**	His captive daughter from the victor’s chain.
**1.3.3**	Suppliant the venerable father stands;
**1.3.4**	Apollo’s awful ensigns grace his hands
**1.3.5**	By these he begs; and lowly bending down,
**1.3.6**	Extends the sceptre and the laurel crown
**1.3.7**	He sued to all, but chief implored for grace
**1.3.8**	The brother-kings, of Atreus’ royal race



**1.4.1**	“Ye kings and warriors! may your vows be crown’d,
**1.4.2**	And Troy’s proud walls lie level with the ground.
**1.4.3**	May Jove restore you when your toils are o’er
**1.4.4**	Safe to the pleasures of your native shore.
**1.4.5**	But, oh! relieve a wretched parent’s pain,
**1.4.6**	And give Chryseis to these arms again;
**1.4.7**	If mercy fail, yet let my presents move,
**1.4.8**	And dread avenging Phoebus, son of Jove.”



**1.5.1**	The Greeks in shouts their joint assent declare,
**1.5.2**	The priest to reverence, and release the fair.
**1.5.3**	Not so Atrides; he, with kingly pride,
**1.5.4**	Repulsed the sacred sire, and thus replied:



**1.6.1**	“Hence on thy life, and fly these hostile plains,
**1.6.2**	Nor ask, presumptuous, what the king detains
**1.6.3**	Hence, with thy laurel crown, and golden rod,
**1.6.4**	Nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god.
**1.6.5**	Mine is thy daughter, priest, and shall remain;
**1.6.6**	And prayers, and tears, and bribes, shall plead in vain;
**1.6.7**	Till time shall rifle every youthful grace,
**1.6.8**	And age dismiss her from my cold embrace,
**1.6.9**	In daily labours of the loom employ’d,
**1.6.10**	Or doom’d to deck the bed she once enjoy’d
**1.6.11**	Hence then; to Argos shall the maid retire,
**1.6.12**	Far from her native soil and weeping sire.”



**1.7.1**	The trembling priest along the shore return’d,
**1.7.2**	And in the anguish of a father mourn’d.
**1.7.3**	Disconsolate, not daring to complain,
**1.7.4**	Silent he wander’d by the sounding main;
**1.7.5**	Till, safe at distance, to his god he prays,
**1.7.6**	The god who darts around the world his rays.



**1.8.1**	“O Smintheus! sprung from fair Latona’s line,
**1.8.2**	Thou guardian power of Cilla the divine,
**1.8.3**	Thou source of light! whom Tenedos adores,
**1.8.4**	And whose bright presence gilds thy Chrysa’s shores.
**1.8.5**	If e’er with wreaths I hung thy sacred fane,
**1.8.6**	Or fed the flames with fat of oxen slain;
**1.8.7**	God of the silver bow! thy shafts employ,
**1.8.8**	Avenge thy servant, and the Greeks destroy.”



**1.9.1**	Thus Chryses pray’d.--the favouring power attends,
**1.9.2**	And from Olympus’ lofty tops descends.
**1.9.3**	Bent was his bow, the Grecian hearts to wound;
**1.9.4**	Fierce as he moved, his silver shafts resound.
**1.9.5**	Breathing revenge, a sudden night he spread,
**1.9.6**	And gloomy darkness roll’d about his head.
**1.9.7**	The fleet in view, he twang’d his deadly bow,
**1.9.8**	And hissing fly the feather’d fates below.
**1.9.9**	On mules and dogs the infection first began;
**1.9.10**	And last, the vengeful arrows fix’d in man.
**1.9.11**	For nine long nights, through all the dusky air,
**1.9.12**	The pyres, thick-flaming, shot a dismal glare.
**1.9.13**	But ere the tenth revolving day was run,
**1.9.14**	Inspired by Juno, Thetis’ godlike son
**1.9.15**	Convened to council all the Grecian train;
**1.9.16**	For much the goddess mourn’d her heroes slain.
**1.9.17**	The assembly seated, rising o’er the rest,
**1.9.18**	Achilles thus the king of men address’d:



**1.10.1**	“Why leave we not the fatal Trojan shore,
**1.10.2**	And measure back the seas we cross’d before?
**1.10.3**	The plague destroying whom the sword would spare,
**1.10.4**	’Tis time to save the few remains of war.
**1.10.5**	But let some prophet, or some sacred sage,
**1.10.6**	Explore the cause of great Apollo’s rage;
**1.10.7**	Or learn the wasteful vengeance to remove
**1.10.8**	By mystic dreams, for dreams descend from Jove.
**1.10.9**	If broken vows this heavy curse have laid,
**1.10.10**	Let altars smoke, and hecatombs be paid.
**1.10.11**	So Heaven, atoned, shall dying Greece restore,
**1.10.12**	And Phoebus dart his burning shafts no more.”



**1.11.1**	He said, and sat: when Chalcas thus replied;
**1.11.2**	Chalcas the wise, the Grecian priest and guide,
**1.11.3**	That sacred seer, whose comprehensive view,
**1.11.4**	The past, the present, and the future knew:
**1.11.5**	Uprising slow, the venerable sage
**1.11.6**	Thus spoke the prudence and the fears of age:



**1.12.1**	“Beloved of Jove, Achilles! would’st thou know
**1.12.2**	Why angry Phoebus bends his fatal bow?
**1.12.3**	First give thy faith, and plight a prince’s word
**1.12.4**	Of sure protection, by thy power and sword:
**1.12.5**	For I must speak what wisdom would conceal,
**1.12.6**	And truths, invidious to the great, reveal,
**1.12.7**	Bold is the task, when subjects, grown too wise,
**1.12.8**	Instruct a monarch where his error lies;
**1.12.9**	For though we deem the short-lived fury past,
**1.12.10**	’Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last.”
**1.12.11**	To whom Pelides:--"From thy inmost soul
**1.12.12**	Speak what thou know’st, and speak without control.
**1.12.13**	E’en by that god I swear who rules the day,
**1.12.14**	To whom thy hands the vows of Greece convey.
**1.12.15**	And whose bless’d oracles thy lips declare;
**1.12.16**	Long as Achilles breathes this vital air,
**1.12.17**	No daring Greek, of all the numerous band,
**1.12.18**	Against his priest shall lift an impious hand;
**1.12.19**	Not e’en the chief by whom our hosts are led,
**1.12.20**	The king of kings, shall touch that sacred head.”



**1.13.1**	Encouraged thus, the blameless man replies:
**1.13.2**	“Nor vows unpaid, nor slighted sacrifice,
**1.13.3**	But he, our chief, provoked the raging pest,
**1.13.4**	Apollo’s vengeance for his injured priest.
**1.13.5**	Nor will the god’s awaken’d fury cease,
**1.13.6**	But plagues shall spread, and funeral fires increase,
**1.13.7**	Till the great king, without a ransom paid,
**1.13.8**	To her own Chrysa send the black-eyed maid.
**1.13.9**	Perhaps, with added sacrifice and prayer,
**1.13.10**	The priest may pardon, and the god may spare.”



**1.14.1**	The prophet spoke: when with a gloomy frown
**1.14.2**	The monarch started from his shining throne;
**1.14.3**	Black choler fill’d his breast that boil’d with ire,
**1.14.4**	And from his eye-balls flash’d the living fire:
**1.14.5**	“Augur accursed! denouncing mischief still,
**1.14.6**	Prophet of plagues, for ever boding ill!
**1.14.7**	Still must that tongue some wounding message bring,
**1.14.8**	And still thy priestly pride provoke thy king?
**1.14.9**	For this are Phoebus’ oracles explored,
**1.14.10**	To teach the Greeks to murmur at their lord?
**1.14.11**	For this with falsehood is my honour stain’d,
**1.14.12**	Is heaven offended, and a priest profaned;
**1.14.13**	Because my prize, my beauteous maid, I hold,
**1.14.14**	And heavenly charms prefer to proffer’d gold?
**1.14.15**	A maid, unmatch’d in manners as in face,
**1.14.16**	Skill’d in each art, and crown’d with every grace;
**1.14.17**	Not half so dear were Clytaemnestra’s charms,
**1.14.18**	When first her blooming beauties bless’d my arms.
**1.14.19**	Yet, if the gods demand her, let her sail;
**1.14.20**	Our cares are only for the public weal:
**1.14.21**	Let me be deem’d the hateful cause of all,
**1.14.22**	And suffer, rather than my people fall.
**1.14.23**	The prize, the beauteous prize, I will resign,
**1.14.24**	So dearly valued, and so justly mine.
**1.14.25**	But since for common good I yield the fair,
**1.14.26**	My private loss let grateful Greece repair;
**1.14.27**	Nor unrewarded let your prince complain,
**1.14.28**	That he alone has fought and bled in vain.”
**1.14.29**	“Insatiate king (Achilles thus replies),
**1.14.30**	Fond of the power, but fonder of the prize!
**1.14.31**	Would’st thou the Greeks their lawful prey should yield,
**1.14.32**	The due reward of many a well-fought field?



**1.15.1**	The spoils of cities razed and warriors slain,
**1.15.2**	We share with justice, as with toil we gain;
**1.15.3**	But to resume whate’er thy avarice craves
**1.15.4**	(That trick of tyrants) may be borne by slaves.
**1.15.5**	Yet if our chief for plunder only fight,
**1.15.6**	The spoils of Ilion shall thy loss requite,
**1.15.7**	Whene’er, by Jove’s decree, our conquering powers
**1.15.8**	Shall humble to the dust her lofty towers.”



**1.16.1**	Then thus the king: "Shall I my prize resign
**1.16.2**	With tame content, and thou possess’d of thine?
**1.16.3**	Great as thou art, and like a god in fight,
**1.16.4**	Think not to rob me of a soldier’s right.
**1.16.5**	At thy demand shall I restore the maid?
**1.16.6**	First let the just equivalent be paid;
**1.16.7**	Such as a king might ask; and let it be
**1.16.8**	A treasure worthy her, and worthy me.
**1.16.9**	Or grant me this, or with a monarch’s claim
**1.16.10**	This hand shall seize some other captive dame.
**1.16.11**	The mighty Ajax shall his prize resign;
**1.16.12**	Ulysses’ spoils, or even thy own, be mine.
**1.16.13**	The man who suffers, loudly may complain;
**1.16.14**	And rage he may, but he shall rage in vain.
**1.16.15**	But this when time requires.--It now remains
**1.16.16**	We launch a bark to plough the watery plains,
**1.16.17**	And waft the sacrifice to Chrysa’s shores,
**1.16.18**	With chosen pilots, and with labouring oars.
**1.16.19**	Soon shall the fair the sable ship ascend,
**1.16.20**	And some deputed prince the charge attend:
**1.16.21**	This Creta’s king, or Ajax shall fulfil,
**1.16.22**	Or wise Ulysses see perform’d our will;
**1.16.23**	Or, if our royal pleasure shall ordain,
**1.16.24**	Achilles’ self conduct her o’er the main;
**1.16.25**	Let fierce Achilles, dreadful in his rage,
**1.16.26**	The god propitiate, and the pest assuage.”



**1.17.1**	At this, Pelides, frowning stern, replied:
**1.17.2**	“O tyrant, arm’d with insolence and pride!
**1.17.3**	Inglorious slave to interest, ever join’d
**1.17.4**	With fraud, unworthy of a royal mind!
**1.17.5**	What generous Greek, obedient to thy word,
**1.17.6**	Shall form an ambush, or shall lift the sword?
**1.17.7**	What cause have I to war at thy decree?
**1.17.8**	The distant Trojans never injured me;
**1.17.9**	To Phthia’s realms no hostile troops they led:
**1.17.10**	Safe in her vales my warlike coursers fed;
**1.17.11**	Far hence removed, the hoarse-resounding main,
**1.17.12**	And walls of rocks, secure my native reign,
**1.17.13**	Whose fruitful soil luxuriant harvests grace,
**1.17.14**	Rich in her fruits, and in her martial race.
**1.17.15**	Hither we sail’d, a voluntary throng,
**1.17.16**	To avenge a private, not a public wrong:
**1.17.17**	What else to Troy the assembled nations draws,
**1.17.18**	But thine, ungrateful, and thy brother’s cause?
**1.17.19**	Is this the pay our blood and toils deserve;
**1.17.20**	Disgraced and injured by the man we serve?
**1.17.21**	And darest thou threat to snatch my prize away,
**1.17.22**	Due to the deeds of many a dreadful day?
**1.17.23**	A prize as small, O tyrant! match’d with thine,
**1.17.24**	As thy own actions if compared to mine.
**1.17.25**	Thine in each conquest is the wealthy prey,
**1.17.26**	Though mine the sweat and danger of the day.
**1.17.27**	Some trivial present to my ships I bear:
**1.17.28**	Or barren praises pay the wounds of war.
**1.17.29**	But know, proud monarch, I’m thy slave no more;
**1.17.30**	My fleet shall waft me to Thessalia’s shore:
**1.17.31**	Left by Achilles on the Trojan plain,
**1.17.32**	What spoils, what conquests, shall Atrides gain?”



**1.18.1**	To this the king: "Fly, mighty warrior! fly;
**1.18.2**	Thy aid we need not, and thy threats defy.
**1.18.3**	There want not chiefs in such a cause to fight,
**1.18.4**	And Jove himself shall guard a monarch’s right.
**1.18.5**	Of all the kings (the god’s distinguish’d care)
**1.18.6**	To power superior none such hatred bear:
**1.18.7**	Strife and debate thy restless soul employ,
**1.18.8**	And wars and horrors are thy savage joy,
**1.18.9**	If thou hast strength, ’twas Heaven that strength bestow’d;
**1.18.10**	For know, vain man! thy valour is from God.
**1.18.11**	Haste, launch thy vessels, fly with speed away;
**1.18.12**	Rule thy own realms with arbitrary sway;
**1.18.13**	I heed thee not, but prize at equal rate
**1.18.14**	Thy short-lived friendship, and thy groundless hate.
**1.18.15**	Go, threat thy earth-born Myrmidons:--but here
**1.18.16**	’Tis mine to threaten, prince, and thine to fear.
**1.18.17**	Know, if the god the beauteous dame demand,
**1.18.18**	My bark shall waft her to her native land;
**1.18.19**	But then prepare, imperious prince! prepare,
**1.18.20**	Fierce as thou art, to yield thy captive fair:
**1.18.21**	Even in thy tent I’ll seize the blooming prize,
**1.18.22**	Thy loved Briseis with the radiant eyes.
**1.18.23**	Hence shalt thou prove my might, and curse the hour
**1.18.24**	Thou stood’st a rival of imperial power;
**1.18.25**	And hence, to all our hosts it shall be known,
**1.18.26**	That kings are subject to the gods alone.”



**1.19.1**	Achilles heard, with grief and rage oppress’d,
**1.19.2**	His heart swell’d high, and labour’d in his breast;
**1.19.3**	Distracting thoughts by turns his bosom ruled;
**1.19.4**	Now fired by wrath, and now by reason cool’d:
**1.19.5**	That prompts his hand to draw the deadly sword,
**1.19.6**	Force through the Greeks, and pierce their haughty lord;
**1.19.7**	This whispers soft his vengeance to control,
**1.19.8**	And calm the rising tempest of his soul.
**1.19.9**	Just as in anguish of suspense he stay’d,
**1.19.10**	While half unsheathed appear’d the glittering blade,
**1.19.11**	Minerva swift descended from above,
**1.19.12**	Sent by the sister and the wife of Jove
**1.19.13**	(For both the princes claim’d her equal care);
**1.19.14**	Behind she stood, and by the golden hair
**1.19.15**	Achilles seized; to him alone confess’d;
**1.19.16**	A sable cloud conceal’d her from the rest.
**1.19.17**	He sees, and sudden to the goddess cries,
**1.19.18**	Known by the flames that sparkle from her eyes:



**1.20.1**	“Descends Minerva, in her guardian care,
**1.20.2**	A heavenly witness of the wrongs I bear
**1.20.3**	From Atreus’ son?--Then let those eyes that view
**1.20.4**	The daring crime, behold the vengeance too.”



**1.21.1**	“Forbear (the progeny of Jove replies)
**1.21.2**	To calm thy fury I forsake the skies:
**1.21.3**	Let great Achilles, to the gods resign’d,
**1.21.4**	To reason yield the empire o’er his mind.
**1.21.5**	By awful Juno this command is given;
**1.21.6**	The king and you are both the care of heaven.
**1.21.7**	The force of keen reproaches let him feel;
**1.21.8**	But sheathe, obedient, thy revenging steel.
**1.21.9**	For I pronounce (and trust a heavenly power)
**1.21.10**	Thy injured honour has its fated hour,
**1.21.11**	When the proud monarch shall thy arms implores
**1.21.12**	And bribe thy friendship with a boundless store.
**1.21.13**	Then let revenge no longer bear the sway;
**1.21.14**	Command thy passions, and the gods obey.”



**1.22.1**	To her Pelides:--"With regardful ear,
**1.22.2**	’Tis just, O goddess! I thy dictates hear.
**1.22.3**	Hard as it is, my vengeance I suppress:
**1.22.4**	Those who revere the gods the gods will bless.”
**1.22.5**	He said, observant of the blue-eyed maid;
**1.22.6**	Then in the sheath return’d the shining blade.
**1.22.7**	The goddess swift to high Olympus flies,
**1.22.8**	And joins the sacred senate of the skies.



**1.23.1**	Nor yet the rage his boiling breast forsook,
**1.23.2**	Which thus redoubling on Atrides broke:
**1.23.3**	“O monster! mix’d of insolence and fear,
**1.23.4**	Thou dog in forehead, but in heart a deer!
**1.23.5**	When wert thou known in ambush’d fights to dare,
**1.23.6**	Or nobly face the horrid front of war?
**1.23.7**	’Tis ours, the chance of fighting fields to try;
**1.23.8**	Thine to look on, and bid the valiant die:
**1.23.9**	So much ’tis safer through the camp to go,
**1.23.10**	And rob a subject, than despoil a foe.
**1.23.11**	Scourge of thy people, violent and base!
**1.23.12**	Sent in Jove’s anger on a slavish race;
**1.23.13**	Who, lost to sense of generous freedom past,
**1.23.14**	Are tamed to wrongs;--or this had been thy last.
**1.23.15**	Now by this sacred sceptre hear me swear,
**1.23.16**	Which never more shall leaves or blossoms bear,
**1.23.17**	Which sever’d from the trunk (as I from thee)
**1.23.18**	On the bare mountains left its parent tree;
**1.23.19**	This sceptre, form’d by temper’d steel to prove
**1.23.20**	An ensign of the delegates of Jove,
**1.23.21**	From whom the power of laws and justice springs
**1.23.22**	(Tremendous oath! inviolate to kings);
**1.23.23**	By this I swear:--when bleeding Greece again
**1.23.24**	Shall call Achilles, she shall call in vain.
**1.23.25**	When, flush’d with slaughter, Hector comes to spread
**1.23.26**	The purpled shore with mountains of the dead,
**1.23.27**	Then shall thou mourn the affront thy madness gave,
**1.23.28**	Forced to deplore when impotent to save:
**1.23.29**	Then rage in bitterness of soul to know
**1.23.30**	This act has made the bravest Greek thy foe.”



**1.24.1**	He spoke; and furious hurl’d against the ground
**1.24.2**	His sceptre starr’d with golden studs around:
**1.24.3**	Then sternly silent sat. With like disdain
**1.24.4**	The raging king return’d his frowns again.



**1.25.1**	To calm their passion with the words of age,
**1.25.2**	Slow from his seat arose the Pylian sage,
**1.25.3**	Experienced Nestor, in persuasion skill’d;
**1.25.4**	Words, sweet as honey, from his lips distill’d:
**1.25.5**	Two generations now had pass’d away,
**1.25.6**	Wise by his rules, and happy by his sway;
**1.25.7**	Two ages o’er his native realm he reign’d,
**1.25.8**	And now the example of the third remain’d.
**1.25.9**	All view’d with awe the venerable man;
**1.25.10**	Who thus with mild benevolence began:--



**1.26.1**	“What shame, what woe is this to Greece! what joy
**1.26.2**	To Troy’s proud monarch, and the friends of Troy!
**1.26.3**	That adverse gods commit to stern debate
**1.26.4**	The best, the bravest, of the Grecian state.
**1.26.5**	Young as ye are, this youthful heat restrain,
**1.26.6**	Nor think your Nestor’s years and wisdom vain.
**1.26.7**	A godlike race of heroes once I knew,
**1.26.8**	Such as no more these aged eyes shall view!
**1.26.9**	Lives there a chief to match Pirithous’ fame,
**1.26.10**	Dryas the bold, or Ceneus’ deathless name;
**1.26.11**	Theseus, endued with more than mortal might,
**1.26.12**	Or Polyphemus, like the gods in fight?
**1.26.13**	With these of old, to toils of battle bred,
**1.26.14**	In early youth my hardy days I led;
**1.26.15**	Fired with the thirst which virtuous envy breeds,
**1.26.16**	And smit with love of honourable deeds,
**1.26.17**	Strongest of men, they pierced the mountain boar,
**1.26.18**	Ranged the wild deserts red with monsters’ gore,
**1.26.19**	And from their hills the shaggy Centaurs tore:
**1.26.20**	Yet these with soft persuasive arts I sway’d;
**1.26.21**	When Nestor spoke, they listen’d and obey’d.
**1.26.22**	If in my youth, even these esteem’d me wise;
**1.26.23**	Do you, young warriors, hear my age advise.
**1.26.24**	Atrides, seize not on the beauteous slave;
**1.26.25**	That prize the Greeks by common suffrage gave:
**1.26.26**	Nor thou, Achilles, treat our prince with pride;
**1.26.27**	Let kings be just, and sovereign power preside.
**1.26.28**	Thee, the first honours of the war adorn,
**1.26.29**	Like gods in strength, and of a goddess born;
**1.26.30**	Him, awful majesty exalts above
**1.26.31**	The powers of earth, and sceptred sons of Jove.
**1.26.32**	Let both unite with well-consenting mind,
**1.26.33**	So shall authority with strength be join’d.
**1.26.34**	Leave me, O king! to calm Achilles’ rage;
**1.26.35**	Rule thou thyself, as more advanced in age.
**1.26.36**	Forbid it, gods! Achilles should be lost,
**1.26.37**	The pride of Greece, and bulwark of our host.”



**1.27.1**	This said, he ceased. The king of men replies:
**1.27.2**	“Thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.
**1.27.3**	But that imperious, that unconquer’d soul,
**1.27.4**	No laws can limit, no respect control.
**1.27.5**	Before his pride must his superiors fall;
**1.27.6**	His word the law, and he the lord of all?
**1.27.7**	Him must our hosts, our chiefs, ourself obey?
**1.27.8**	What king can bear a rival in his sway?
**1.27.9**	Grant that the gods his matchless force have given;
**1.27.10**	Has foul reproach a privilege from heaven?”



**1.28.1**	Here on the monarch’s speech Achilles broke,
**1.28.2**	And furious, thus, and interrupting spoke:
**1.28.3**	“Tyrant, I well deserved thy galling chain,
**1.28.4**	To live thy slave, and still to serve in vain,
**1.28.5**	Should I submit to each unjust decree:--
**1.28.6**	Command thy vassals, but command not me.
**1.28.7**	Seize on Briseis, whom the Grecians doom’d
**1.28.8**	My prize of war, yet tamely see resumed;
**1.28.9**	And seize secure; no more Achilles draws
**1.28.10**	His conquering sword in any woman’s cause.
**1.28.11**	The gods command me to forgive the past:
**1.28.12**	But let this first invasion be the last:
**1.28.13**	For know, thy blood, when next thou darest invade,
**1.28.14**	Shall stream in vengeance on my reeking blade.”



**1.29.1**	At this they ceased: the stern debate expired:
**1.29.2**	The chiefs in sullen majesty retired.



**1.30.1**	Achilles with Patroclus took his way
**1.30.2**	Where near his tents his hollow vessels lay.
**1.30.3**	Meantime Atrides launch’d with numerous oars
**1.30.4**	A well-rigg’d ship for Chrysa’s sacred shores:
**1.30.5**	High on the deck was fair Chryseis placed,
**1.30.6**	And sage Ulysses with the conduct graced:
**1.30.7**	Safe in her sides the hecatomb they stow’d,
**1.30.8**	Then swiftly sailing, cut the liquid road.



**1.31.1**	The host to expiate next the king prepares,
**1.31.2**	With pure lustrations, and with solemn prayers.
**1.31.3**	Wash’d by the briny wave, the pious train
**1.31.4**	Are cleansed; and cast the ablutions in the main.
**1.31.5**	Along the shore whole hecatombs were laid,
**1.31.6**	And bulls and goats to Phoebus’ altars paid;
**1.31.7**	The sable fumes in curling spires arise,
**1.31.8**	And waft their grateful odours to the skies.



**1.32.1**	The army thus in sacred rites engaged,
**1.32.2**	Atrides still with deep resentment raged.
**1.32.3**	To wait his will two sacred heralds stood,
**1.32.4**	Talthybius and Eurybates the good.
**1.32.5**	“Haste to the fierce Achilles’ tent (he cries),
**1.32.6**	Thence bear Briseis as our royal prize:
**1.32.7**	Submit he must; or if they will not part,
**1.32.8**	Ourself in arms shall tear her from his heart.”



**1.33.1**	The unwilling heralds act their lord’s commands;
**1.33.2**	Pensive they walk along the barren sands:
**1.33.3**	Arrived, the hero in his tent they find,
**1.33.4**	With gloomy aspect on his arm reclined.
**1.33.5**	At awful distance long they silent stand,
**1.33.6**	Loth to advance, and speak their hard command;
**1.33.7**	Decent confusion! This the godlike man
**1.33.8**	Perceived, and thus with accent mild began:



**1.34.1**	“With leave and honour enter our abodes,
**1.34.2**	Ye sacred ministers of men and gods!
**1.34.3**	I know your message; by constraint you came;
**1.34.4**	Not you, but your imperious lord I blame.
**1.34.5**	Patroclus, haste, the fair Briseis bring;
**1.34.6**	Conduct my captive to the haughty king.
**1.34.7**	But witness, heralds, and proclaim my vow,
**1.34.8**	Witness to gods above, and men below!
**1.34.9**	But first, and loudest, to your prince declare
**1.34.10**	(That lawless tyrant whose commands you bear),
**1.34.11**	Unmoved as death Achilles shall remain,
**1.34.12**	Though prostrate Greece shall bleed at every vein:
**1.34.13**	The raging chief in frantic passion lost,
**1.34.14**	Blind to himself, and useless to his host,
**1.34.15**	Unskill’d to judge the future by the past,
**1.34.16**	In blood and slaughter shall repent at last.”



**1.35.1**	Patroclus now the unwilling beauty brought;
**1.35.2**	She, in soft sorrows, and in pensive thought,
**1.35.3**	Pass’d silent, as the heralds held her hand,
**1.35.4**	And of look’d back, slow-moving o’er the strand.
**1.35.5**	Not so his loss the fierce Achilles bore;
**1.35.6**	But sad, retiring to the sounding shore,
**1.35.7**	O’er the wild margin of the deep he hung,
**1.35.8**	That kindred deep from whence his mother sprung:
**1.35.9**	There bathed in tears of anger and disdain,
**1.35.10**	Thus loud lamented to the stormy main:



**1.36.1**	“O parent goddess! since in early bloom
**1.36.2**	Thy son must fall, by too severe a doom;
**1.36.3**	Sure to so short a race of glory born,
**1.36.4**	Great Jove in justice should this span adorn:
**1.36.5**	Honour and fame at least the thunderer owed;
**1.36.6**	And ill he pays the promise of a god,
**1.36.7**	If yon proud monarch thus thy son defies,
**1.36.8**	Obscures my glories, and resumes my prize.”



**1.37.1**	Far from the deep recesses of the main,
**1.37.2**	Where aged Ocean holds his watery reign,
**1.37.3**	The goddess-mother heard. The waves divide;
**1.37.4**	And like a mist she rose above the tide;
**1.37.5**	Beheld him mourning on the naked shores,
**1.37.6**	And thus the sorrows of his soul explores.
**1.37.7**	“Why grieves my son? Thy anguish let me share;
**1.37.8**	Reveal the cause, and trust a parent’s care.”



**1.38.1**	He deeply sighing said: "To tell my woe
**1.38.2**	Is but to mention what too well you know.
**1.38.3**	From Thebe, sacred to Apollo’s name
**1.38.4**	(Aetion’s realm), our conquering army came,
**1.38.5**	With treasure loaded and triumphant spoils,
**1.38.6**	Whose just division crown’d the soldier’s toils;
**1.38.7**	But bright Chryseis, heavenly prize! was led,
**1.38.8**	By vote selected, to the general’s bed.
**1.38.9**	The priest of Phoebus sought by gifts to gain
**1.38.10**	His beauteous daughter from the victor’s chain;
**1.38.11**	The fleet he reach’d, and, lowly bending down,
**1.38.12**	Held forth the sceptre and the laurel crown,
**1.38.13**	Intreating all; but chief implored for grace
**1.38.14**	The brother-kings of Atreus’ royal race:
**1.38.15**	The generous Greeks their joint consent declare,
**1.38.16**	The priest to reverence, and release the fair;
**1.38.17**	Not so Atrides: he, with wonted pride,
**1.38.18**	The sire insulted, and his gifts denied:
**1.38.19**	The insulted sire (his god’s peculiar care)
**1.38.20**	To Phoebus pray’d, and Phoebus heard the prayer:
**1.38.21**	A dreadful plague ensues: the avenging darts
**1.38.22**	Incessant fly, and pierce the Grecian hearts.
**1.38.23**	A prophet then, inspired by heaven, arose,
**1.38.24**	And points the crime, and thence derives the woes:
**1.38.25**	Myself the first the assembled chiefs incline
**1.38.26**	To avert the vengeance of the power divine;
**1.38.27**	Then rising in his wrath, the monarch storm’d;
**1.38.28**	Incensed he threaten’d, and his threats perform’d:
**1.38.29**	The fair Chryseis to her sire was sent,
**1.38.30**	With offer’d gifts to make the god relent;
**1.38.31**	But now he seized Briseis’ heavenly charms,
**1.38.32**	And of my valour’s prize defrauds my arms,
**1.38.33**	Defrauds the votes of all the Grecian train;
**1.38.34**	And service, faith, and justice, plead in vain.
**1.38.35**	But, goddess! thou thy suppliant son attend.
**1.38.36**	To high Olympus’ shining court ascend,
**1.38.37**	Urge all the ties to former service owed,
**1.38.38**	And sue for vengeance to the thundering god.
**1.38.39**	Oft hast thou triumph’d in the glorious boast,
**1.38.40**	That thou stood’st forth of all the ethereal host,
**1.38.41**	When bold rebellion shook the realms above,
**1.38.42**	The undaunted guard of cloud-compelling Jove:
**1.38.43**	When the bright partner of his awful reign,
**1.38.44**	The warlike maid, and monarch of the main,
**1.38.45**	The traitor-gods, by mad ambition driven,
**1.38.46**	Durst threat with chains the omnipotence of Heaven.
**1.38.47**	Then, call’d by thee, the monster Titan came
**1.38.48**	(Whom gods Briareus, men Aegeon name),
**1.38.49**	Through wondering skies enormous stalk’d along;
**1.38.50**	Not he that shakes the solid earth so strong:
**1.38.51**	With giant-pride at Jove’s high throne he stands,
**1.38.52**	And brandish’d round him all his hundred hands:
**1.38.53**	The affrighted gods confess’d their awful lord,
**1.38.54**	They dropp’d the fetters, trembled, and adored.
**1.38.55**	This, goddess, this to his remembrance call,
**1.38.56**	Embrace his knees, at his tribunal fall;
**1.38.57**	Conjure him far to drive the Grecian train,
**1.38.58**	To hurl them headlong to their fleet and main,
**1.38.59**	To heap the shores with copious death, and bring
**1.38.60**	The Greeks to know the curse of such a king.
**1.38.61**	Let Agamemnon lift his haughty head
**1.38.62**	O’er all his wide dominion of the dead,
**1.38.63**	And mourn in blood that e’er he durst disgrace
**1.38.64**	The boldest warrior of the Grecian race.”



**1.39.1**	“Unhappy son! (fair Thetis thus replies,
**1.39.2**	While tears celestial trickle from her eyes)
**1.39.3**	Why have I borne thee with a mother’s throes,
**1.39.4**	To Fates averse, and nursed for future woes?
**1.39.5**	So short a space the light of heaven to view!
**1.39.6**	So short a space! and fill’d with sorrow too!
**1.39.7**	O might a parent’s careful wish prevail,
**1.39.8**	Far, far from Ilion should thy vessels sail,
**1.39.9**	And thou, from camps remote, the danger shun
**1.39.10**	Which now, alas! too nearly threats my son.
**1.39.11**	Yet (what I can) to move thy suit I’ll go
**1.39.12**	To great Olympus crown’d with fleecy snow.
**1.39.13**	Meantime, secure within thy ships, from far
**1.39.14**	Behold the field, not mingle in the war.
**1.39.15**	The sire of gods and all the ethereal train,
**1.39.16**	On the warm limits of the farthest main,
**1.39.17**	Now mix with mortals, nor disdain to grace
**1.39.18**	The feasts of Aethiopia’s blameless race,
**1.39.19**	Twelve days the powers indulge the genial rite,
**1.39.20**	Returning with the twelfth revolving light.
**1.39.21**	Then will I mount the brazen dome, and move
**1.39.22**	The high tribunal of immortal Jove.”



**1.40.1**	The goddess spoke: the rolling waves unclose;
**1.40.2**	Then down the steep she plunged from whence she rose,
**1.40.3**	And left him sorrowing on the lonely coast,
**1.40.4**	In wild resentment for the fair he lost.



**1.41.1**	In Chrysa’s port now sage Ulysses rode;
**1.41.2**	Beneath the deck the destined victims stow’d:
**1.41.3**	The sails they furl’d, they lash the mast aside,
**1.41.4**	And dropp’d their anchors, and the pinnace tied.
**1.41.5**	Next on the shore their hecatomb they land;
**1.41.6**	Chryseis last descending on the strand.
**1.41.7**	Her, thus returning from the furrow’d main,
**1.41.8**	Ulysses led to Phoebus’ sacred fane;
**1.41.9**	Where at his solemn altar, as the maid
**1.41.10**	He gave to Chryses, thus the hero said:



**1.42.1**	“Hail, reverend priest! to Phoebus’ awful dome
**1.42.2**	A suppliant I from great Atrides come:
**1.42.3**	Unransom’d, here receive the spotless fair;
**1.42.4**	Accept the hecatomb the Greeks prepare;
**1.42.5**	And may thy god who scatters darts around,
**1.42.6**	Atoned by sacrifice, desist to wound.”



**1.43.1**	At this, the sire embraced the maid again,
**1.43.2**	So sadly lost, so lately sought in vain.
**1.43.3**	Then near the altar of the darting king,
**1.43.4**	Disposed in rank their hecatomb they bring;
**1.43.5**	With water purify their hands, and take
**1.43.6**	The sacred offering of the salted cake;
**1.43.7**	While thus with arms devoutly raised in air,
**1.43.8**	And solemn voice, the priest directs his prayer:



**1.44.1**	“God of the silver bow, thy ear incline,
**1.44.2**	Whose power incircles Cilla the divine;
**1.44.3**	Whose sacred eye thy Tenedos surveys,
**1.44.4**	And gilds fair Chrysa with distinguish’d rays!
**1.44.5**	If, fired to vengeance at thy priest’s request,
**1.44.6**	Thy direful darts inflict the raging pest:
**1.44.7**	Once more attend! avert the wasteful woe,
**1.44.8**	And smile propitious, and unbend thy bow.”



**1.45.1**	So Chryses pray’d. Apollo heard his prayer:
**1.45.2**	And now the Greeks their hecatomb prepare;
**1.45.3**	Between their horns the salted barley threw,
**1.45.4**	And, with their heads to heaven, the victims slew:
**1.45.5**	The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide;
**1.45.6**	The thighs, selected to the gods, divide:
**1.45.7**	On these, in double cauls involved with art,
**1.45.8**	The choicest morsels lay from every part.
**1.45.9**	The priest himself before his altar stands,
**1.45.10**	And burns the offering with his holy hands.
**1.45.11**	Pours the black wine, and sees the flames aspire;
**1.45.12**	The youth with instruments surround the fire:
**1.45.13**	The thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress’d,
**1.45.14**	The assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest:
**1.45.15**	Then spread the tables, the repast prepare;
**1.45.16**	Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.
**1.45.17**	When now the rage of hunger was repress’d,
**1.45.18**	With pure libations they conclude the feast;
**1.45.19**	The youths with wine the copious goblets crown’d,
**1.45.20**	And, pleased, dispense the flowing bowls around;
**1.45.21**	With hymns divine the joyous banquet ends,
**1.45.22**	The paeans lengthen’d till the sun descends:
**1.45.23**	The Greeks, restored, the grateful notes prolong;
**1.45.24**	Apollo listens, and approves the song.



**1.46.1**	’Twas night; the chiefs beside their vessel lie,
**1.46.2**	Till rosy morn had purpled o’er the sky:
**1.46.3**	Then launch, and hoist the mast: indulgent gales,
**1.46.4**	Supplied by Phoebus, fill the swelling sails;
**1.46.5**	The milk-white canvas bellying as they blow,
**1.46.6**	The parted ocean foams and roars below:
**1.46.7**	Above the bounding billows swift they flew,
**1.46.8**	Till now the Grecian camp appear’d in view.
**1.46.9**	Far on the beach they haul their bark to land,
**1.46.10**	(The crooked keel divides the yellow sand,)
**1.46.11**	Then part, where stretch’d along the winding bay,
**1.46.12**	The ships and tents in mingled prospect lay.



**1.47.1**	But raging still, amidst his navy sat
**1.47.2**	The stern Achilles, stedfast in his hate;
**1.47.3**	Nor mix’d in combat, nor in council join’d;
**1.47.4**	But wasting cares lay heavy on his mind:
**1.47.5**	In his black thoughts revenge and slaughter roll,
**1.47.6**	And scenes of blood rise dreadful in his soul.



**1.48.1**	Twelve days were past, and now the dawning light
**1.48.2**	The gods had summon’d to the Olympian height:
**1.48.3**	Jove, first ascending from the watery bowers,
**1.48.4**	Leads the long order of ethereal powers.
**1.48.5**	When, like the morning-mist in early day,
**1.48.6**	Rose from the flood the daughter of the sea:
**1.48.7**	And to the seats divine her flight address’d.
**1.48.8**	There, far apart, and high above the rest,
**1.48.9**	The thunderer sat; where old Olympus shrouds
**1.48.10**	His hundred heads in heaven, and props the clouds.
**1.48.11**	Suppliant the goddess stood: one hand she placed
**1.48.12**	Beneath his beard, and one his knees embraced.
**1.48.13**	“If e’er, O father of the gods! (she said)
**1.48.14**	My words could please thee, or my actions aid,
**1.48.15**	Some marks of honour on my son bestow,
**1.48.16**	And pay in glory what in life you owe.
**1.48.17**	Fame is at least by heavenly promise due
**1.48.18**	To life so short, and now dishonour’d too.
**1.48.19**	Avenge this wrong, O ever just and wise!
**1.48.20**	Let Greece be humbled, and the Trojans rise;
**1.48.21**	Till the proud king and all the Achaian race
**1.48.22**	Shall heap with honours him they now disgrace.”



**1.49.1**	Thus Thetis spoke; but Jove in silence held
**1.49.2**	The sacred counsels of his breast conceal’d.
**1.49.3**	Not so repulsed, the goddess closer press’d,
**1.49.4**	Still grasp’d his knees, and urged the dear request.
**1.49.5**	“O sire of gods and men! thy suppliant hear;
**1.49.6**	Refuse, or grant; for what has Jove to fear?
**1.49.7**	Or oh! declare, of all the powers above,
**1.49.8**	Is wretched Thetis least the care of Jove?”



**1.50.1**	She said; and, sighing, thus the god replies,
**1.50.2**	Who rolls the thunder o’er the vaulted skies:



**1.51.1**	“What hast thou ask’d? ah, why should Jove engage
**1.51.2**	In foreign contests and domestic rage,
**1.51.3**	The gods’ complaints, and Juno’s fierce alarms,
**1.51.4**	While I, too partial, aid the Trojan arms?
**1.51.5**	Go, lest the haughty partner of my sway
**1.51.6**	With jealous eyes thy close access survey;
**1.51.7**	But part in peace, secure thy prayer is sped:
**1.51.8**	Witness the sacred honours of our head,
**1.51.9**	The nod that ratifies the will divine,
**1.51.10**	The faithful, fix’d, irrevocable sign;
**1.51.11**	This seals thy suit, and this fulfils thy vows--”
**1.51.12**	He spoke, and awful bends his sable brows,
**1.51.13**	Shakes his ambrosial curls, and gives the nod,
**1.51.14**	The stamp of fate and sanction of the god:
**1.51.15**	High heaven with trembling the dread signal took,
**1.51.16**	And all Olympus to the centre shook.



**1.52.1**	Swift to the seas profound the goddess flies,
**1.52.2**	Jove to his starry mansions in the skies.
**1.52.3**	The shining synod of the immortals wait
**1.52.4**	The coming god, and from their thrones of state
**1.52.5**	Arising silent, wrapp’d in holy fear,
**1.52.6**	Before the majesty of heaven appear.
**1.52.7**	Trembling they stand, while Jove assumes the throne,
**1.52.8**	All, but the god’s imperious queen alone:
**1.52.9**	Late had she view’d the silver-footed dame,
**1.52.10**	And all her passions kindled into flame.
**1.52.11**	“Say, artful manager of heaven (she cries),
**1.52.12**	Who now partakes the secrets of the skies?
**1.52.13**	Thy Juno knows not the decrees of fate,
**1.52.14**	In vain the partner of imperial state.
**1.52.15**	What favourite goddess then those cares divides,
**1.52.16**	Which Jove in prudence from his consort hides?”



**1.53.1**	To this the thunderer: "Seek not thou to find
**1.53.2**	The sacred counsels of almighty mind:
**1.53.3**	Involved in darkness likes the great decree,
**1.53.4**	Nor can the depths of fate be pierced by thee.
**1.53.5**	What fits thy knowledge, thou the first shalt know;
**1.53.6**	The first of gods above, and men below;
**1.53.7**	But thou, nor they, shall search the thoughts that roll
**1.53.8**	Deep in the close recesses of my soul.”



**1.54.1**	Full on the sire the goddess of the skies
**1.54.2**	Roll’d the large orbs of her majestic eyes,
**1.54.3**	And thus return’d:--"Austere Saturnius, say,
**1.54.4**	From whence this wrath, or who controls thy sway?
**1.54.5**	Thy boundless will, for me, remains in force,
**1.54.6**	And all thy counsels take the destined course.
**1.54.7**	But ’tis for Greece I fear: for late was seen,
**1.54.8**	In close consult, the silver-footed queen.
**1.54.9**	Jove to his Thetis nothing could deny,
**1.54.10**	Nor was the signal vain that shook the sky.
**1.54.11**	What fatal favour has the goddess won,
**1.54.12**	To grace her fierce, inexorable son?
**1.54.13**	Perhaps in Grecian blood to drench the plain,
**1.54.14**	And glut his vengeance with my people slain.”



**1.55.1**	Then thus the god: "O restless fate of pride,
**1.55.2**	That strives to learn what heaven resolves to hide;
**1.55.3**	Vain is the search, presumptuous and abhorr’d,
**1.55.4**	Anxious to thee, and odious to thy lord.
**1.55.5**	Let this suffice: the immutable decree
**1.55.6**	No force can shake: what is, that ought to be.
**1.55.7**	Goddess, submit; nor dare our will withstand,
**1.55.8**	But dread the power of this avenging hand:
**1.55.9**	The united strength of all the gods above
**1.55.10**	In vain resists the omnipotence of Jove.”



**1.56.1**	The thunderer spoke, nor durst the queen reply;
**1.56.2**	A reverent horror silenced all the sky.
**1.56.3**	The feast disturb’d, with sorrow Vulcan saw
**1.56.4**	His mother menaced, and the gods in awe;
**1.56.5**	Peace at his heart, and pleasure his design,
**1.56.6**	Thus interposed the architect divine:
**1.56.7**	“The wretched quarrels of the mortal state
**1.56.8**	Are far unworthy, gods! of your debate:
**1.56.9**	Let men their days in senseless strife employ,
**1.56.10**	We, in eternal peace and constant joy.
**1.56.11**	Thou, goddess-mother, with our sire comply,
**1.56.12**	Nor break the sacred union of the sky:
**1.56.13**	Lest, roused to rage, he shake the bless’d abodes,
**1.56.14**	Launch the red lightning, and dethrone the gods.
**1.56.15**	If you submit, the thunderer stands appeased;
**1.56.16**	The gracious power is willing to be pleased.”



**1.57.1**	Thus Vulcan spoke: and rising with a bound,
**1.57.2**	The double bowl with sparkling nectar crown’d,
**1.57.3**	Which held to Juno in a cheerful way,
**1.57.4**	“Goddess (he cried), be patient and obey.
**1.57.5**	Dear as you are, if Jove his arm extend,
**1.57.6**	I can but grieve, unable to defend
**1.57.7**	What god so daring in your aid to move,
**1.57.8**	Or lift his hand against the force of Jove?
**1.57.9**	Once in your cause I felt his matchless might,
**1.57.10**	Hurl’d headlong down from the ethereal height;
**1.57.11**	Toss’d all the day in rapid circles round,
**1.57.12**	Nor till the sun descended touch’d the ground.
**1.57.13**	Breathless I fell, in giddy motion lost;
**1.57.14**	The Sinthians raised me on the Lemnian coast;



**1.58.1**	He said, and to her hands the goblet heaved,
**1.58.2**	Which, with a smile, the white-arm’d queen received
**1.58.3**	Then, to the rest he fill’d; and in his turn,
**1.58.4**	Each to his lips applied the nectar’d urn,
**1.58.5**	Vulcan with awkward grace his office plies,
**1.58.6**	And unextinguish’d laughter shakes the skies.



**1.59.1**	Thus the blest gods the genial day prolong,
**1.59.2**	In feasts ambrosial, and celestial song.
**1.59.3**	Apollo tuned the lyre; the Muses round
**1.59.4**	With voice alternate aid the silver sound.
**1.59.5**	Meantime the radiant sun to mortal sight
**1.59.6**	Descending swift, roll’d down the rapid light:
**1.59.7**	Then to their starry domes the gods depart,
**1.59.8**	The shining monuments of Vulcan’s art:
**1.59.9**	Jove on his couch reclined his awful head,
**1.59.10**	And Juno slumber’d on the golden bed.
